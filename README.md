# Grand_Start
This is my first repository of my life and I will remember it.
This start is energetic as it is first time for me using github, so I want something interesting to do.
I made this file to give small info of my program which is something different from everyday task.
It is something fun, something new and little bit craziness.
So, with me, enjoy this moment!
