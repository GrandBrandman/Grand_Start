# Grand_Start
This is my first repository of my life and I will remember it.
This start is energetic as I am using Github for the first time. So I thought something interesting should be done.
I made this file to give small info about my program which is something different from everyday task.
It is something fun, something new and little bit craziness.
So, with me, enjoy this moment!
